### Exploratory Data Analysis - Uber Case Study

Objective : To extract actionable insights from the data that we have collected over the past 6 months to optimise resources andidentify area of growth and improvement.

Focused majorly on - Variables that influence the pickups, Factors that affects pickups the most and Ways to capitalize the fluctuating demands

The data contains weather information, location and number of pickups

* Performed univariate analysis on variables in the data
* Performed bivariate analysis to better understand the correlation between different variables
* Created Visualizations to explore data and extract the insights

Conclusions
* Uber cabs are most popular in the Manhattan area of New York.    
* Contrary to intuition, weather conditions do not have much impact on the number of Uber pickups.
* The demand for Uber has been increasing steadily over the months (Jan to June).
* The rate of pickups is higher on the weekends as compared to weekdays.
* It is encouraging to see that New Yorkers trust Uber taxi services when they step out to enjoy their evenings.
* We can also conclude that people use Uber for regular office commutes. The demand steadily increases from 6 AM to 10 AM, then declines a little and starts picking up     till midnight. The demand peaks at 7-8 PM.
* We need to further investigate the low demand for Uber on Mondays.
